        "Feature engineering can involve many different techniques, such as scaling, normalization, one-hot encoding, and dimensionality reduction. Let's take a look at a few examples of how feature engineering can be used to improve a neural network model.\n",
        "\n",
        "####**Scaling:** \n",
        "This involves scaling the input variables so that they are on the same scale. For example, if you have two input variables, one measured in kilograms and the other measured in millimeters, they may be on different scales which can make it difficult for the model to learn. Scaling the variables to the same range (e.g., 0 to 1) can improve the model's performance.\n",
        "####**One-hot encoding:**\n",
        "This is a technique used for categorical variables, where each category is transformed into a binary variable. For example, if you have a categorical variable like \"color\" with categories \"red\", \"green\", and \"blue\", you could create three binary variables (one for each category) that take on a value of 1 if the original variable is that category, and 0 otherwise. This can help the model to learn patterns in the data more easily. \n",
        "####**Dimensionality reduction:**\n",
        "This involves reducing the number of input variables by combining them into a smaller set of variables. For example, if you have many variables that are highly correlated, you could use principal component analysis (PCA) to create a smaller set of variables that capture the most important information. This can help to reduce the complexity of the model and improve its performance."
